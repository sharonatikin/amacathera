It also profiled Dr. Shoichet's biotechnology career at the University of Toronto, where she is a university professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Applied Chemistry.",
    "Here's an excerpt:",
    "AmacaThera's core material is an invention licensed from the lab that combines hyaluronic acid, commonly used in anti-wrinkle cosmetics, and methyl cellulose, which turns into a gel when heated.

FedEx provides the packaging and figures out how to get what's inside where and when it needs to be there.'",
    "AmacaThera's initial target is postoperative pain relief. Doctors typically use local anesthetics such as bupivacaine for surgeries. But the drugs wear off in 12 to 18 hours, at which point opioids are prescribed for pain relief. Studies have shown that leads to millions of cases of opioid dependency annually.",
    "Dr. Shoichet and Mr. Cooke believe that if their hydrogel can hold and gradually release a larger dose of the anesthetic over three days, it can get postsurgical patients to the point where they don't need opioids. 'That could improve pain management, cut hospital stays and reduce opioid addictions. 'The economic effect [would be] huge, and on top of that there's the benefit to the patients and society,' Mr. Cooke said.",

      "Recruiting the Chief Scientist is part of the five-year, $650-million Business Growth Initiative, which is helping to grow the economy and create jobs by promoting an innovation-based economy, helping small companies scale up and modernize and improving requirements for business.\nOntario held public consultations to help determine the skills and experience the Chief Scientist should possess, and how this role could best advance science.\nA recent survey by the Ontario Science Centre shows that many Canadians lack an awareness and understanding of science. Four in 10 said they think science is not for people like them and $3 per cent consider themselves science illiterate.\nCanada ranks among the world's top 10 countries for total research publication output, and Ontario produced about 46 per cent of Canada's national output from 2009 to 2014.\nOntario plans to create 10,000 more postsecondary students graduating in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines by 25 per cent over the next five years, to 50,000 per year. This will give Ontario the highest number per capita of postsecondary STEM graduates in North America.",
